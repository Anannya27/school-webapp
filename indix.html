                another session on 'Entrepreneur' by Dr. Kaushal Kumar Jha. Students were oriented how to create and
                develop an idea and then to make a business plan for the same. Afternoon session was the time for students
                to exhibit their models for the competition "I am a Student Entrepreneur". To encourage the students,
                certificates and prizes were given for out of the box ideas. Students enjoyed the fest a lot and walked
                out of the ATL Lab as budding innovators and entrepreneurs.

            <p class="list-group-item-text"> Education is the means of developing our greater abilities, because in each of us there is great hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation. Each day, children of varying abilities, talents, interests, and backgrounds work and play together. We encourage our students to challenge themselves, celebrating their creativity, initiative and individuality, through their daily interactions in the classroom, as well as, through their participation in our many Extra Curricular programmes. Our students are provided with the foundation for a lifelong love of learning.

                I am privileged to be the principal of such an outstanding school and consider myself lucky that so many wonderful students, staff members, and families touch my life each day. Students and teachers have discussed, worked together, laughed, enjoyed and disagreed too……but after it all, they have worked together as a TEAM and come up with brilliant results in every field. We have all been busy…. Busy taking risks; busy learning. It takes a lot of energy to try new things. It is time to celebrate both their effort and the results. Our upcoming vacation is a good time to do that. Parents, your contributions have given us the courage to go forth and explore new terrains in education.

                The school's partnership with our parents is very important to the success of our students and school. Even though I spend a lot of time in classrooms and in areas where I can be with students and on rounds, inspecting the school, I can be reached with relative ease. We are partners in your children's education so please keep an active and open line of communication with all of us at MWS.</p>
